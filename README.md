# My-Quote-API
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, EXPRESS practice

In order to run the API the node modules folder must be copied in the API folder (I need to find out if there is another way) because git ignores it. 
Then run npm start or node script.js

Description: 
The API is not linked to a database yet, the data (arrays of quote objects - with have id, quote and author) is located in data.js.
Functionality:
  - fetches quotes by author from the entire database 
  - gets all quotes or a random quote for each selected theme (from technology, love, life) 
  - the user can add quotes, modify quotes and delete quotes (the last two are not yet completed)
